--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER: Colonel Arthur Pemberton
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REASONING:

1. MOTIVE: Prevent exposure of 1998 insurance fraud
   - Lord Ashford had evidence of embezzlement
   - Pemberton faced criminal charges and disgrace if exposed
   - The threatening letter references "the money from '98"

2. OPPORTUNITY: Admitted presence in study at time of death
   - Pemberton admits being in the study 10:05-10:20 PM
   - Gardener saw limping figure going TO study at 10:20 PM
   - Gardener saw same figure RETURNING at 10:30-35 PM
   - Pemberton claims he left at 10:20 PM - this contradicts gardener's sighting

3. MEANS: Access to poison and physical capability
   - Belladonna plants stolen from garden 2 weeks prior
   - Pemberton knew the garden (walks there for his leg)
   - Strong enough to wield candlestick despite age

4. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Footprints match his gait pattern
   - Muddy footprints show limping gait (left side)
   - Men's UK size 10 - matches Pemberton
   - Trail leads to/from garden door

SEQUENCE OF EVENTS:
1. Poison placed in brandy glass before or during evening
2. Pemberton visited study at 10:05 PM for "frank discussion"
3. Argument: "I know what you did... I have proof"
4. Lord Ashford drank poisoned brandy during confrontation
5. As poison took effect, struck with candlestick
6. Pemberton fled via garden door around 10:30 PM
7. Eleanor discovered body at 10:30 PM

KEY CONTRADICTIONS:
- Pemberton says he left at 10:20 PM
- Gardener saw limping figure RETURNING at 10:30-35 PM
- This 10-15 minute gap is when the murder occurred
